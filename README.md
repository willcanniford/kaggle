# Kaggle
[Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/willcanniford) - go and have a look! 

This repository houses some of the main code that I have used during my Kaggle projects. There will generally be a folder for each of the projects, and the data will have been obtained from Kaggle itself; this means that more information about the data can be found there.  

I will try and link to the rendered code on Kaggle within each folder and project so you can find it easily. If you are a member and like the project then please upvote the kernel, or leave me some constructive feedback so that I can improve!
